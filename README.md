# Swift-Rain
A rain animation class created in Swift using gravity and UIKit. It's incredibly easy to use - drag the WaterController class into your project and write 2 lines of code.

```
let waterController = WaterController(view: yourView)
waterController.start()
```

The rain animation automatically adapts to the size of the view you are using. You can customize properties such as the rain color and frequencies in the WaterController class.

This project is tested with BrowserStack
